CrazyDot Previous Changelog:
	Version 1 - 11/26/14
		Sub Folders not working correctly
		Will work if files are in root folder
		Ellipses need to be tighter
		Basic analysis of mean, min, max and area of background, noise and signal
	Version 1.1 - 12/1/14
		Ellipses fixed, adequately tight around signal spots
			Threshold changed to 0.05
			First loop searches until the current pixel is 1-threshold of the brightness (Default is 95% of brightness)
			Second loop searches until the change in brightness ratio is less than threshold (Default is 5%)
		Fixed Recursive functionality
	Version 1.1.1 - 12/2/14
		Renamed Noise to Cell Noise
		Fixed File naming when files are in sub folders
		Added Mean and Median Signal to Cell Noise Ratio above Background in results
			Calculates the Signal and Cell Noise above the background level
	Version 1.2 - 12/3/14
		Saves Histogram of signal, cell noise and background in histogram subfolder in the output directory
		Does a basic statistical analysis of the spots, removes the bottom 7% of spots selected
	Version 1.3 - 12/4/14
		Changed zscore to a negative value to reflect the actual zscore
		Fixed setThreshold, was originally setMinAndMax
		renamed threshold variable to tolerance to better reflect its function
		Added tolerancemultiplier to be more tolerant of increases in pixel brightness
		Added UI
		Fixed Polygon function, still needs work though
		Results are now copied to a separate table and saved as one file
		Removed Histogram image functionality
			Images would not save without giving an error
	Version 1.4 - 12/12/14
		Added framework for variable maxima
	Version 1.5 - 12/16/14
		Polygon function Changes
			No longer buffers area by one
			Fixed threshold check, some lines contained a less than instead of greater than
		Added derivative function
			Takes the first derivative of the image and uses that to determine the noise value
			Incorporates the zscore, lower means more local maxima
			Replaces removing the bottom x percent of spots
		Changed results formatting
		Added Labels to images
	Version 1.6 - 12/17/14
		Moved result table manipulation to results function
		Re-enabled Histogram in Signal, Noise and Background functions
		Added Explanation of variables in dialog
		Added information on variables in first line of final results
	Version 1.7 - 12/29/14
		Histogram
			Save function requires the file path contain only \, no /
			Created a stripath value that contains the extension stripped path name without the / in it
		Changed file open command to run("Bioformats Importer"... to ensure the image is opened as a grey scale image
		Changed derivative function so it calculates maxima from median, not mean.  Reduces error for  bright spots skewing the mean
			Extremely bright spots still mess up the analysis
		Changed Noise to Default threshold instead of Li
			Ran into issues with Li and low noise levels
			Default chooses more noise area when the noise levels are low
			Li would just choose the area directly surrounding the signal
		Added warnings for debugging and notifying the user of errors in analysis
